# Bank Loan Analysis - SQL & Power BI

## Project Overview

This project analyzes bank loan data using SQL and Power BI to track key financial trends, loan application patterns, and bank profitability. The SQL queries perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), while Power BI visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) for better decision-making.

## SQL Analysis

The SQL file includes various queries to analyze:

Total Loan Applications: Count of all loan applications.

Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications: Loan applications for a specific month and year.

Loan Application Percentage: Monthly share of total loan applications.

Growth Rate Analysis: Month-over-month changes in loan applications.

Profitability Analysis: Calculating net profit from loans based on payments and loan amounts.

Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI report provides interactive visualizations and insights, including:

## KPIs:

Loan Approval Rate

Default Rate

Total Revenue from Loans

Net Profit Trends

## Visualizations:

Time series charts showing loan trends

Profitability breakdowns by customer segments

Monthly comparisons of loan performance

How to Use

SQL Analysis: Run the queries in a PostgreSQL or similar database to extract insights.

Power BI Dashboard: Import the dataset into Power BI and explore the interactive reports.

Conclusion

This project provides a data-driven approach to understanding bank loan performance and profitability. The combination of SQL and Power BI enables efficient financial analysis and decision-making.
